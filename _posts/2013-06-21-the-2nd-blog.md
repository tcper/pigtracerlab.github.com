###Try to write somthing in English

To be honestly, the blog setup on github is so obscure, I mean, in my sensation, github can only host static html pages on its server, this sensation obscured me a lot.

At last, I find that, it just need to save `.md` file on `gh-pages` branch, that the blog is ok to use.

And, the `_config.yml` obscured me a lot tooooâ€¦

But finally, I makes this all done.
